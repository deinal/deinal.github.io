I research how particle jets' energy can be corrected for using deep learning on data from the [CMS](https://cms.cern) experiment at CERN. 

### Experience

- Research assistant at [Helsinki Institute of Physics](https://www.hip.fi) performing deep neural network regression to determine jet energy corrections
- Full-stack developer at [Fjuul](https://fjuul.com), I worked with Node.js and Google Cloud Platform
- Research assistant at [Helsinki Accelerator Laboratory](https://helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/helsinki-accelerator-laboratory) where we simulated iron-chromium alloys using molecular dynamics
- Further information in my [CV](https://deinal.github.io/assets/holmberg_daniel_cv.pdf)

### What else?

- I started as a [helper on CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.github.io/2020-05-25-online/#helpers), promoting reproducible research and good coding practices
- Every now and then [I write](https://medium.com/@deinal) for Towards Data Science, a Medium publication
- I do random coding projects with others or by myself, some of them are in the projects tab, the rest can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/deinal)
