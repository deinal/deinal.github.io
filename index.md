I have a physics background (BSc) and now I am studying data science. I also work part-time as a developer, and I enjoy doing coding projects with others in general. We are in the process of creating a material that teaches coding in swedish with a few buddies at the moment. I run in my free time to calm my mind and stay healthy :)
